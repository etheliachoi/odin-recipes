        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite dishes! My go-to whenever my bf is not home to eat with me - quick and easy! Frankly, I would recommend buying the frozen, premade ones than making them from scratch (especially the wrapping) :3 But if you have an afternoon to spare, try this recipe!</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Prepare dipping sauce: Combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, chives, sesame seeds, and chile sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare dumplings: Mix pork, garlic, egg, chives, soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Place a dumpling wrapper on a lightly floured work surface and spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the middle.</li>
            <li>Wet the edge with a little water and crimp together forming small pleats to seal the dumpling. Repeat to form remaining dumplings.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place 8 to 10 dumplings in the pan and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
