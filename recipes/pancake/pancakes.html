        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The ultimate best buttermilk pancake! The pancake I have been wanting and waiting to make for a year now :(</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="unordered">
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tbsp white sugar</li>
            <li>3 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1&frac12; tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>&frac34; tsp salt</li>
            <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>&frac13; cup melted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div>
            <ol class="ordered">
                <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter in a separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>
                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.</li>
                <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</li>
                <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
